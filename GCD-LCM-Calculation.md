# How to calculate the greatest common divisor? 

Divisors are numbers that can be divided into a number without a remainder. So how to find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers. To start you must note down all divisible numbers for each given number. You then find the highest number that is divisible giving you the answer. 

## An example:

#### 12|1,2,3,4,(6),12.
#### 18|1,2,3,(6),9,18.

Above are the numbers that are divisible by 12 and 18. 6 is the highest shared number which makes it the highest common divisor.
