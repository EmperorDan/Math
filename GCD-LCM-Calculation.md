# How to calculate the greatest common divisor? 

Divisors are numbers that can be divided into a number without a remainder. So how to find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers. To start you must note down all divisible numbers for each given number. You then find the highest number that is divisible giving you the answer. 

## Example:

Below are the numbers that are divisible by 12 and 18. 6 is the highest shared number (divisor) which makes it the highest common divisor.

#### 12|1,2,3,4,(6),12.
#### 18|1,2,3,(6),9,18.



# How to calculate the least common-multiple of a given pair of numbers?

To start we need to note down the multiples of your given pair. After doing that you need to note the lowest multiples of each given numbers. You should now make two equations made up of the lowest multiples, times together, these should both work out as your given numbers. You then combine the two equations. Using the least numbers your new equation must work out as both your given numbers. You then solve your equation giving you the answer.     

## Example:

#### The multiples are:
#### 18| 1x18, 2x9, 3x6. 
#### 16| 1x16, 2x8, 4x4.

#### You then take find the common multiple
#### 18| 2x9
#### 16| 2x8

#### The next thing to do is break these equations down to their lowest form
#### 18| 2x3x3
#### 16| 2x2x2x2

You then combine the two making another equation. This one must only use numbers nessarary to make both
