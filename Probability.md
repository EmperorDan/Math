# Probability

## What is the probability of having 7 when rolling two die?

To work this out you have to add the numbers on the two dice to see how many times 7 is made. After doing this you should see 6 combinations that make 7. This means out of the 36 possible rolls 6 of them make 7 which makes the answer 6/36 (simplified to 1/6).

## What is the probability of having having at least one 2 when rolling two die?

## What is the probability of having a 7, knowing for sure that I will roll a 2?
