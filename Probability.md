#### What is the probability of having 7 when rolling two die?

To work this out you have to add the numbers on the two dice to see how many times 7 is made. After doing this you should see 6 combinations that make 7. This means out of the 36 possible rolls 6 of them make 7 which makes the answer 6/36 (simplified to 1/6).

#### What is the probability of having having at least one 2 when rolling two die?

The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6, for both die. One way to work this problem out is to get the probability of 2 not rolling, for both die, which is 5/6. You then multiply them, to combine the probabilities, which makes 25/36. 25/36 is the probability of a 3 not being rolled with two die, making 11/36 the probability of it rolling.  

#### What is the probability of having 7 after rolling a 2?

Since the first roll was 2 the second die needs to land on 5, meaning there are only 6 possible outcomes. so the probability is 1/6. 

#### What is the probability of having a 7, knowing for sure that I will roll a 2?

Since the first roll was 2 the second die needs to land on 5, meaning there are only 6 possible outcomes. so the probability is 1/6.
