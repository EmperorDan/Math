# Integral Calculus
## Used to Solve Practical Problems Involving Area

Integral calculus is used to calculate the area under a curve. You start by filling the underside of the curve with an infinite set of rectangles.

After filling the space you work out the area of each rectangle that was able to fit. With this information you will be able to work out the area below the curve.
