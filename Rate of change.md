# Rate of change within an algebraic function

Rate of change is common place in society. Examples of this include Mile per gallon, Mile per hour, cost per kilowatt, ect. Miles per gallon is calculated by dividing miles travelled by the amount of gallons used. So now we know what rate of change is we now look at its translation in algebra. 

## Average rate of change function

## Example 1:


### F(x) = x2 


### Rate of change from 1 to 3 


### (3² - 1²) / (3 - 1) = (9 – 1) / (3 – 1) = 8/2 = 4     -     Binary = 0000 0100 

## Example 2:


### F(x) = 2x+3 


### Rate of change from 10 to 100 


### (2*100 + 3) –(2*10 + 3) / (100 – 10) = 180 / 90 = 2    -   Hexadecimal = 2
