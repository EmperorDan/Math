# Probability of a random integer being divisible by 5
## Answer
The answer to this question is obvious. One out of every five numbers is divisible by 5, meaning there is a 1/5 chance. 5 can be divided by numbers in the 5 timetables such as 20,25,30 which means 5 is divisible 1/5 times. Whereas 0,1,2,3, or 4 dont have the same probability to equate, or be divisible by 5.
