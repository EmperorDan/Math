## Arithmetic Progression
Look at this sequence of numbers below:
#### 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
You will notice this sequence is progressing by three each time. This is what we call arithmetic progression ('AP' for short). Below is the arithmetic behind the sequence shown above:
#### 1,      3,          5,            7,            9
#### 1,    1 + 2,    1 + 2 × 2,    1 + 3 × 2,    1 + 4 × 2, 
The first term of the sequence is where you start. We will be starting with the number one. If you look at the above formulae you will realise that 2 is consistent in each sum this shows us its the common difference.
The common way of representing this information above is the use of algebra. Below is how this process would translate:
#### a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d
